Productivity5000 Iniitial Version

Productivity5000 is intended to be a basic capture program with the Getting Things Done(GTD) methodology in mind.

The idea is to quickly capture ideas with a minimal design and plenty of space for getting notes in. The initial version is text only.

Structure:

This structure is intended to be customizable. What is listed is the default used by the author. The structure is a hierarchical structure with each level having an option of folders or notes.

Paradigm

The paradigm is the compartmentalization of notes and tasks. An example of the paradigm categories is work, school, and personal. This category is considered to be the only deviation from what would make this program for a GTD Purist (In David Allen's GTD method he has work and other tasks all part of the same system.) The paradigms are optional, so one can optionally not create additional paradigms to keep everything in one system.

Inbox

The inbox is for capturing and quickly responding to data and tasks. It has subfolders that include: Inbox: the inbox->inbox are quick ideas and items to be organized. Next Actions: A list of the next actions of projects. Daily Todo: Items that are to be completed today, additional notes of tasks uncompleted or unarchived from before.

Projects

Projects are where different projects are tracked, subfolders here include: Project List: A list of projects Project ToDos: A breakdown of what needs to be done for each project. An optional tag of text for a ToDo being a next action

Reference

The reference category is for items that are for later review, subfolders include: Someday / Maybe: Item list of things to someday maybe be done. Contacts: A list of contact information like a rolodex. Work Locations / Context: This is a list for use in tagging for items that can be done at certain locations or certain contexts. Examples include: Home Office, Cell phone, Nice Weather

Archive

For the archive the structure above is mirrored for each paradigm.
